# Fargate service for one Go binary from this repo (order-service,
# inventory-service, or notification-service). Deliberately narrow: no
# VPC/ALB/ECR creation here — those are assumed to exist already and are
# passed in via variables, so this module's job is exactly "run this
# container reliably," which is the boundary the JD's "own services from
# design through production" line is pointing at.
